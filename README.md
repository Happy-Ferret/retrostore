**RetroStore** aims to be an app store that is home to often long forgotten games and apps on platforms from our past.

Take e.g. a system like the [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80). There are many games and apps that have been
developped for it but are hard to come by nowadays. Often there is no commercial interest anymore from the original
authors. 

However, there are often vibrant communities about these old platforms and emulators that try to keep the history alive.
While these emulators ([like this one for Android](https://github.com/apuder/TRS-80)) are doing a fantastic job, they
suffer from the absence of easy to obtain and install app images.

This is where **RetroStore** comes in. It aims to provide an open platform to store and distribute these old gems. It
does so by offering forms to upload old application images, and and API for accessing them. The APIs can be used by
emulators to easily add these titles to their applications.

For now we aim to only support application without commercial interest. Should there be desire to at some point have
authors sell games and apps for these old platforms, we would rethink this model and add an incentive model.

Initial platform will be the TRS-80. If you are an emulator developer for this or another platform, feel free to reach
out so we can expand support.
